We have many competitions available. In hackathons like NUS Hack&Roll or iNTUition, you can ‘hack’ together a prototype app in 24 hours. CTFs like SMU Whitehacks, Cyberthon or the Cyber Defenders Discovery Camp let you race other teams to hack (the real one) into mock environments. Finally, some members compete in the prestigious National Olympiad in Informatics (NOI). In CSS, we try to make CCa sessions fun through certain activities such as Kahoot!, mini competitons and many more! What do we learn in CSS? There are different courses available such as web development, where you can learn how to create your own website, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, which are essential skills required in the technological industry right now. In all of our courses, you will have opportunities to collaborate with and learn from other members. We also have semi-regular bonding sessions, where we play games that are sometimes computer-themed and many times not. You can also look forward to our club camp and possible learning journeys outside regular CCA hours!
